!> Finds indices of netcells that relate to structures.
!! The indices will be used when partitioning the mesh with METIS, by giving a special weight on the netcells.
!! As a result, structures will not intercross the partition boundaries
!! NOTE: This functionality ONLY supports when using "polylinefile" to specify the structure location
!! TODO: extend it to support other ways of specifying the structure location.
